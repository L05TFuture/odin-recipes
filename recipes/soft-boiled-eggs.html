        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken eggs</strong>: You can use white or brown chicken eggs. The cooking temperature will differ slightly.</li>
            <li> <strong>Water</strong>: Of course you need water to cook the eggs</li>
            <li><strong>Soy sauce</strong>: This adds nice umami to the half-boiled eggs</li>
            <li><strong>Ground white pepper</strong>: It’s a must for me to have ground white pepper to go with the half-boiled eggs. It’s just not the same without it</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
            <p><ol>
                <li>GET THE EGGS OUT FROM THE FRIDGE: Let them sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes</li>
                <li>RING WATER TO A ROLLING BOIL: While waiting for the eggs, bring water in a saucepan to a rolling boil</li>B
                <li>TURN OFF HEAT AND LOWER EGGS INTO THE WATER: Use a spoon to lower the eggs into the hot water</li>
                <li>CLOSE THE LID: The residual heat will gently cook the eggs</li>
                <li>SET TIMER TO 7 MINUTES: I suggest using digital timer on the stove or your phone for accuracy</li>
                <li>REMOVE EGGS FROM THE WATER: When the timer is up, use a spoon to quickly remove the eggs from the hot water to a bowl to stop the cooking process</li>
                <li>Crack the egg into a bowl</li>
                </ol></p>
